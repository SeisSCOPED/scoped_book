# High-Performance Seismology

This book offers tutorials and documentation to process large amount of seismic data and simulate wavefields at large scale for high-performance seismology. The book builds from the grounds up to get familiar with  coding best practices in *Open Science*, develop and deploy large-scale data mining and processing on servers and cloud infrastructure, deploy machine-learning workflow on the cloud, simulate seismic wavefield on HPC systems, perform bayesian inference and full waveform inversion on HPC.
